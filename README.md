# CantoneseOnTheGo

This is a little tool I made to help me learning Cantonese (as well as working on Angular development). If anyone has any suggested phrases please give a shout out. I would love to learn more about how to sound like a real local. 

After starting this project I learnt that there are differences in the way Mandarin and Cantonese speakers will says things. In future improvements I might need to provide how it is said in Mandarin rather than provide a direct translation.
